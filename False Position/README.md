# **False Position**
### *This algorithm has a focus on determining the roots of a function through the false position method*
---
####-`Inputs:` *(MUST) function, lower bound, upper bound | (OPTIONAL) error, max number of itterations* 
####-`Outputs:` *root location, function value at root, error, number of itterations*
####-`Limitations:` *bounds must be on a continuous segment of the function, the lower and upper bounds can not have a function value of the same sign, for a function with a known distinct root (i.e.[x^2-4]) the result may not be exact or distinct*

#### *(This folder contains both a False Position test and primary function .m file in MATLAB)*
