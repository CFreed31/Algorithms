# **Lower Upper Factorization**
### *This algorithm deals with calculating the Lower and Upper triangular matricies out of a standard square matrix*
---
#### -`Inputs:` *must enter a coefficient matrix with square dimensions (denoted as 'A' in algorithm)* 
#### -`Outputs:` *the lower triangular matrix, upper triangular matrix, and permutation matrix (L,U, and P respectively)*
#### -`Limitations:` *the limitations to this matrix are that the entered matrix must be square and contain numbers, opposed to letters*
---
#### *(This folder contains both a LU test and primary function .m file in MATLAB)*
